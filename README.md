# Deep-Learning-Project
These are kernels submitted for LANL Earthquake Prediction Competition on Kaggle. It includes:

* Our best submission, a stacked ensemble composed of 5 sub-models:
  * GRU
  * LSTM
  * Stacked GRU
  * FFT
  * CRNN

* A second stacked ensemble composed of 4 sub-models:
  * GRU
  * LSTM
  * Stacked GRU
  * GP

* An attempt using an autoencoder for feature extraction and an RNN for inferences
