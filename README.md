# Deep-Learning-Project
These are kernels submitted for LANL Earthquake Prediction Competition on Kaggle. It includes our best submission, a GRU based RNN ("RNN Starter for Huge Time Series Data"), our submission using an autoencoder for feature extraction, and our current submission, a stacked generalization ensemble of sequence models.
